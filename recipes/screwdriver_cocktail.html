    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This simple mixture of vodka and orange juice reportedly gets its name from the original tool used to stir the drink — a screwdriver. You'll get equally good results using a spoon. This screwdriver is an easy but refreshing cocktail recipe made by combining orange juice and vodka over ice.   
     <ul>
       <li>6 fluid ounces orange juice</li> 
       <li>1 ½ fluid ounces vodka</li> 
       <li>1 ½ cups ice cubes</li> 

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine orange juice and vodka in a highball glass and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add ice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
